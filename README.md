# Longitudinal Analysis - Final Project

Introduction
Nepal is one of the least developed and one of the poorest countries on Earth. As an effect of this nearly half of the families in Nepal live in poverty. With poverty comes lack of nutrition. Approximately 40% of Nepal’s population is children under the age of 18. Thus, the health of children is very important to grow and help the country develop, as the outcome of the younger generation is the outcome of the future. Thus, it is of interest to determine variables that may have an effect on the growth of the children in Nepal. Specifically, the maternal factors of a child’s life. For example, the mother’s age at birth or breastfeeding status. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal analysis to characterize the relationship between children’s growth in Nepal and their mother’s characteristics. 
The study data used for our analysis contains anthropologic measurements on Nepalese children that assessed the impact of vitamin treatment on growth.  However, we only considered the control cases from this larger dataset. The measurements were for 2,258 children at 5 different time points that are about 4 months apart. There was a total of 11,290 observations in the dataset.  Though, there is some missing data, which would leave just 9,552 observations on 2,215 children. For our study, only the first 1,000 observations were considered. We focus on the maternal and growth variables which are weight, height, mother’s age, breast feeding status, mother’s literacy, number of mother’s children that were born alive, and number of mother’s children still born.
